# Kickoff-Game
Game Directions: The game is played like a kickoff return, where you use the arrow keys to follow "blockers" and try to reach the end zone before being tackled by "defenders" or hitting roadblocks(red dots in the field). There are 6 levels of increasing difficulty. Passing a level gives the user 7 points, running over one of the gold stars on a level gives the user 3 points. The top scores in the environment are added to the leaderboard page on the home screen.
