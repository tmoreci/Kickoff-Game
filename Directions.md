# Kickoff Game
The main file is tp.py. Run that file to start the game.
The levels file creates the different levels of the game.
The player file creates classes for the different types of players in the game.
The tracking file creates functions finding the optimal moves for the defenders and blockers.
The high scores file keeps track of the high scores and updates them to the leaderboard text file.
The two graphics files are files I was given by my class to make this project.

Game Directions:
The game is played like a kickoff return, where you use the arrow keys to follow "blockers" and try to reach the end zone before being tackled by "defenders" or hitting roadblocks(red dots in the field). There are 6 levels of increasing difficulty. Passing a level gives the user 7 points, running over one of the gold stars on a level gives the user 3 points. The top scores in the environment are added to the leaderboard page on the home screen.
